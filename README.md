#HotZone
## Deployed at:
https://hotzone3035552765.herokuapp.com/

## Iteration 1:

As expected, the first iteration of HotZone will handle the simple case where there is a single GeoData location that satisfies the search criteria and the location is not already known to HotZone.

## Limitations and Exclusions:

- Editing and Deleting Locations is not allowed.
- Location can only be created based on GeoData Store i.e user cannot choose to input own values for the Location.
- Case Data storage is not supported yet.
- Takes long to load.
